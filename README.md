## Abstract
The automotive industry generates large volumes of sales, pricing, and performance data across multiple regions and product variants. Manual analysis of such data is time-consuming and error-prone. This project focuses on analyzing BMW sales data using business intelligence tools. The dashboard highlights key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Total Sales, Total Price, Average Mileage, and Average Sales.
